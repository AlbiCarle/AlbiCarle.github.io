I am a passionate mathematician with a strong focus on applications of machine learning for both scientific research and industrial innovation. At the University of Genoa (UNIGE), I graduated in 2020 with a masterâ€™s degree in applied mathematics from the Department of Mathematics (DIMA) and later in 2024 I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering (DITEN). Until recently I was also a visiting researcher in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department at UC Berkeley. My current research is on Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI), focusing especially on Reliable Machine Learning, Robust and Adversarial Machine Learning and Uncertainty Quantification (e.g. Conformal Prediction and Order Statistics). During my Ph.D., I also got interested in machine learning for science, particularly the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for learning missing dynamics and model discrepancy.

In July 2024, I got hired from Aitek S.p.A. where I manage industrial research projects in the areas of computer vision, logistics and innovation of critical infrastructures such as ports and highways. Meanwhile, I am also a research fellow at the Institute of Electronics and Information and Telecommunications Engineering of the National Council of Research of Italy (CNR-IEIIT).

Proficient in Python and MATLAB.
